Kentucky Covid chart


This project was used (by my family) to vizuale the state of illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
I used data downloaded in .csv format from The COVID Tracking Project - Kentucky - and used that data to build an interactive dashboard.

Libraries used were primarily Plotly and pandas.
